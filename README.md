# \# Echoes of Imagination

# 

# > Transform stories into immersive visual experiences.

# 

# \## 🚀 Project Overview

# 

# \*\*Echoes of Imagination\*\* is a multimodal AI pipeline designed to bring stories to life.  

# Currently, the project focuses on \*\*generating images from story text\*\*, turning each paragraph into a vivid illustration. In the future, this system will be expanded to \*\*generate accompanying music\*\* based on both the text and generated images, creating a fully immersive storytelling experience.

# 

# \## 🎯 Problem Statement

# 

# Stories have been one of humanity’s oldest ways of sharing knowledge, emotions, and imagination.  

# However, most narratives today remain \*\*text-only\*\*, limiting engagement, especially for younger audiences. There is a need for systems that \*\*translate text into rich multimedia experiences\*\*, combining visuals and sound to enhance comprehension and immersion.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 💡 Current Solution

# 

# \- Breaks stories into short paragraphs or storylets.  

# \- Generates \*\*images corresponding to each storylet\*\* using state-of-the-art text-to-image techniques.  

# \- Maintains \*\*story coherence\*\* by using sequential storytelling datasets and preserving paragraph-image alignment.  

# 

# \*Future expansion\*: Generate music from both text and images to create a fully multimodal narrative experience.

# \## 🛠️ Technology Stack

# 

# \- \*\*Python 3.x\*\*  

# \- \*\*PyTorch / Hugging Face Transformers\*\* for text and image modeling  

# \- \*\*Pandas, Matplotlib, WordCloud\*\* for EDA and visualization  

# \- \*\*Kaggle Datasets\*\*: COCO Captions for pretraining image generation  

# \- \*\*SSID (Sequential Storytelling Image Dataset)\*\* for learning story-image sequence alignment  

# \- \*\*Jupyter Notebooks\*\* for experiments and EDA

# \## ⚡ How to Run

# 

# 1\. Clone the repository:

# ```bash

# git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Echoes-of-Imagination.git

# cd Echoes-of-Imagination

# ```

# 2\. Install dependencies:

# 

# ```bash

# pip install -r requirements.txt

# ```

# 3\. Open and run setup.ipynb to verify dataset loading and view EDA.

# 

# 4\. Use scripts in src/ to train or generate images from story text.

# 

# \## 📈 Future Work

# Integrate music generation based on text and generated images.

# 

# Develop Gradio/Streamlit UI for interactive story-to-image and story-to-music generation.

# 

# Fine-tune models for better narrative coherence across longer stories.
